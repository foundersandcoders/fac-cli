# FAC CLI Requirements (EARS Format)

## Overview
FAC CLI is a command-line interface for managing Founders and Coders training organisation operations. The system fetches data from various third-party sources (starting with Airtable) and displays formatted information in the terminal. Built incrementally with clear separation of concerns using functional programming principles.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-001: Command Routing
**GIVEN** the FAC CLI is installed and executable  
**WHEN** a user runs `./fac.py <command>` with a valid command  
**THEN** the system SHALL route to the appropriate command handler  
**AND** execute the requested functionality

### FR-002: Gateway Recent Command (gr)
**GIVEN** valid Airtable credentials are configured  
**WHEN** a user runs `./fac.py gr`  
**THEN** the system SHALL fetch data from the specified Airtable view  
**AND** display formatted results in the terminal with custom column headers

### FR-003: Airtable Data Fetching
**GIVEN** Airtable URL and credentials are provided  
**WHEN** the gateway recent command is executed  
**THEN** the system SHALL authenticate with Airtable API  
**AND** retrieve specified columns from the configured view  
**AND** handle API errors gracefully

### FR-004: Data Processing
**GIVEN** raw data is fetched from Airtable  
**WHEN** the data processing function is called  
**THEN** the system SHALL transform the data for terminal display  
**AND** apply custom column headers as specified  
**AND** format data for optimal readability

### FR-005: Terminal Display
**GIVEN** processed data is available  
**WHEN** the display function is called  
**THEN** the system SHALL render data in a clear tabular format  
**AND** handle terminal width constraints appropriately  
**AND** provide readable output for the specified columns

### FR-006: Error Handling
**GIVEN** any operation fails (network, authentication, data processing)  
**WHEN** an error occurs  
**THEN** the system SHALL display a clear, actionable error message  
**AND** exit gracefully without crashing  
**AND** log error details for debugging

### FR-007: Extensibility
**GIVEN** the CLI foundation is established  
**WHEN** new commands need to be added  
**THEN** the system SHALL support adding commands via new files  
**AND** maintain clear separation between routing, fetching, processing, and display  
**AND** allow new data sources to be added independently

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001: Performance
The system SHALL respond to commands within 2 seconds for normal Airtable API operations under typical network conditions.

### NFR-002: Code Style
The system SHALL use functional programming patterns with terse, single-responsibility functions using single-word verb naming conventions.

### NFR-003: Modularity
The system SHALL maintain clear separation of concerns with dedicated files for routing, data fetching, processing, and display functions.

### NFR-004: Extensibility
The system SHALL support easy addition of new commands and data sources without modifying existing core functionality.

### NFR-005: Security
The system SHALL handle API credentials securely without hardcoding sensitive information in source code.

### NFR-006: Error Resilience
The system SHALL handle network failures, API errors, and malformed data gracefully without crashing.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `./fac.py gr` command successfully fetches and displays Airtable data
- [ ] Code follows functional programming and terse naming conventions
- [ ] Clear separation between routing, fetching, processing, and display
- [ ] Error handling provides clear feedback to users
- [ ] Architecture supports easy addition of new commands
- [ ] API credentials are handled securely
- [ ] Test coverage > 90% for all components

## Success Metrics

- Gateway recent command executes successfully with valid Airtable data
- Code architecture allows new commands to be added in under 30 minutes
- Error messages are actionable and user-friendly
- All tests pass with comprehensive coverage
- Command responds within 2 seconds under normal conditions

## Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions
- Users have Python 3.9+ installed
- Network connectivity is available for API calls
- Valid Airtable credentials and view URL are provided
- Terminal supports standard text output formatting

### Constraints
- Technology stack: Python with functional programming style
- File structure: fac.py (main), gr.py (gateway recent), separate files for data sources
- API dependency: Airtable API availability and rate limits
- Development approach: Incremental, one command at a time

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Airtable API changes | High | Medium | Abstract API calls, version control integration |
| Network connectivity issues | Medium | Medium | Implement timeout handling and offline error messages |
| API rate limiting | Medium | Low | Implement rate limiting awareness and backoff strategy |
| Credential exposure | High | Low | Use environment variables, secure credential handling |
| Architecture complexity growth | Medium | High | Maintain strict separation of concerns, regular refactoring |
